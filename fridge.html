	<p class="text">This project was intended as a submission to a NineSigma Innovation Contest: <a target="_blank" style= "color:#0000EE;" href="https://ninesights.ninesigma.com/web/unilever-gallery/needs-listing/-/needs-portlet/viewNeed?_NeedsPortlet_WAR_NeedPortletsportlet_needId=706"><u><i>New and Novel Freezing and Cooling Technologies</i></u></a></p>
	<p class="text">The purpose of this challenge was to design an innovative technology to chill and store food without accessing power from the grid. My group and I came up with a solution based loosely from a Zeer Pot. Our solution was to design a pot with a layer of sand or soil around it, surrounding by another pot of a semi-permeable membrane. Water would be added to the sand and when the water evaporated, the entire system would decrease in temperature.</p>

	<p class="text">To gain a visual understanding, we built a sketch model of one our designs. A pyramid shape was chosen because research showed that such a shape has a high surface area to volume ratio, meaning the most cooling will occur. However, a flaw with this deisgn was that the bottom of the fridge was inaccessible, and made this an impractical design.</p>

	<p class="text">The design we settled upon was a cube shape, with a door at the front of the fridge. A water supply would be connected to the top of the system to replenish the water that evaporates out of the sand to keep a constant cooling effect. I drew a section view of the proposed model to outline how the system worked.</p>

	<p class="text">To demonstrate that our design worked, we built a prototype. An exact model could not be built, but the intention was to show that the system decreased in temperature. After allowing the system to cool for a few hours, the thermometer showed a decrease in temperature, showing that our solution worked. Although this design fell short of the target temperature, the cooling effect was apparent.</p>
